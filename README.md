## Description
This is a web-application that uses the Twitch.tv API to find random streams. It allows users to view streams, login and post recommendations for streamers that they find using this app.

## Development
This app was made with Ruby on Rails. No scaffolding was used but I did use generators for the models, db and controllers. Bootstrap was used for styling. Omniauth was used for enabling logins via twitch. The gem 'twitch-api'(https://github.com/mauricew/ruby-twitch-api) was used for making requests to the Twitch API.
